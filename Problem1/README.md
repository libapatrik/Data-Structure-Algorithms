# Problem 1 - Data Structures

Six problems, each one builds a data structure from scratch. See `explanation_X.md` (or the PDFs) for per-problem write-ups.

| # | Problem | Data Structure | Time | Space |
|---|---------|---------------|------|-------|
| 1 | LRU Cache | Dict + Doubly Linked List | O(1) get/set | O(n) |
| 2 | File Recursion | Recursive directory traversal | O(n) | O(n) call stack |
| 3 | Huffman Coding | Priority queue + Binary tree | O(n log n) encode | O(n) |
| 4 | Active Directory | Tree (group hierarchy) + DFS | O(v + e) | O(v) |
| 5 | Blockchain | Linked list + SHA256 hashing | O(1) insert | O(n) |
| 6 | Union & Intersection | Linked list + set operations | O(n) | O(n) |

## Files

Multiple versions of each problem in here (course templates vs solved). `ProblemX_Name.py` files are the descriptive-named originals, `Problem_X.py` are the cleaned-up submissions, `ProblemX.py` are alternate takes.
