Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

This problem is very similar to Problem_5, just asked to implement a bit more complex ideas to tackle the problem.


Time complexity for the trie for searching and inserting from a trie in dependent upon the length of the desired path, hence it O(n). The worst case space complexity would be to have a node for each path, which would result in O(n)
