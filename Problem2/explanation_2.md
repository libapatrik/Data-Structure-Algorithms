Problem 2 : Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

For this problem I have implelemented kind of the same approach. In fact I did use binary serach again.

Goal is to find a pivot point at which the array is rotated and then implement the algorithm.

Time c. of this problem is O(log(n)) - same as before, as we are eliminiting halves of input list.

Space c. is O(1) - because we don't need to store loads into memory.
