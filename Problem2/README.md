# Problem 2 - Searching & Sorting

Seven problems on binary search, sorting, and Tries. Per-problem explanations in `explanation_X.md`.

| # | Problem | Approach | Time | Space |
|---|---------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | Square Root of Integer | Binary search | O(log n) | O(1) |
| 2 | Search in Rotated Sorted Array | Modified binary search (find pivot) | O(log n) | O(1) |
| 3 | Rearrange Array Digits | Frequency counting, build two max numbers | O(n) | O(1) |
| 4 | Dutch National Flag (sort 0,1,2) | Frequency count + reconstruct | O(n) | O(n) |
| 5 | Autocomplete with Trie | Trie insert/search/suffixes | O(n) | O(n) |
| 6 | Max and Min in Unsorted Array | Single-pass linear scan | O(n) | O(1) |
| 7 | HTTP Request Routing | Trie over URL path segments | O(n) | O(n) |
