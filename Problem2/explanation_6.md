Problem 6 : Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

Goal is to return min and max values from an unsorted array.
To solve this, we have to enumerate through whole array only once, and check various if statements such that would yield use to proper output of min_value and max_value. 

Time c. is O(n) - because of single traversal.
Space c. is O(n) - becase we have to store whole array of length n.
