Problem 4 : Dutch National Flag Problem

Procedure is two-fold;
First, calculate frequencies of numbers 0, 1, 2.
Second, create new sorted list using those frequencies.

In such a way, the problem will run in O(n) time complexity - so linear time requirement is met. 
And space complexity is O(n), too as we store array, which requires n slots of memory - where n is length or the input array.
