Problem 3 : Rearrange Array Elements

Goal is to return two maximum sums.
We are iterating through the list to obtain frequency of numbers from input array and store them in a new one.

Given the frequencies then I create two numbers from array and join them to create the list.

Time complexity is O().
Space c. is O(1)
