# Data Structures & Algorithms - Udacity Nanodegree

Coursework and projects from the [Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256), completed in 2020. All solutions in Python.

## Structure

```
Problem0/   Phone call & text record analysis (Project 0)
Problem1/   Data structures from scratch (Project 1)
Problem2/   Searching & sorting algorithms (Project 2)
```

Each folder has its own README.

## Running

No dependencies beyond Python 3. Each file runs standalone:

```bash
python Problem0/Task0.py
```

Problem2's Trie problem is a Jupyter notebook (`Problem_5_Trie.ipynb`).

## Projects

**Problem0** - Analyze phone call and text message records from CSVs. Five tasks: basic lookups, counting unique numbers, cumulative call durations, Bangalore area code analysis, and telemarketer identification. Focus was on runtime analysis.

**Problem1** - Build six data structures: LRU Cache (dict + doubly linked list), file system recursion, Huffman coding, Active Directory group search, a basic blockchain, and linked list union/intersection.

**Problem2** - Binary search (square root, rotated array), sorting (Dutch national flag, rearranging digits), Trie-based autocomplete, finding min/max without built-ins, and HTTP request routing with a Trie.
